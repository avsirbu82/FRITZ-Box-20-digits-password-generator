# FRITZ-Box-20-digits-password-generator
Purpose:
The primary aim of this software is to generate robust 20-digit Wi-Fi passwords that are specifically tailored for FRITZ!Box routers. This utility is designed to help network administrators and individual users test the strength of their Wi-Fi passwords and, consequently, improve their network security.

How It Works:
Utilizing a sophisticated rule-based engine, the software substantially narrows down the possibilities for passwords, targeting the algorithm used by FRITZ!Box routers. This approach has successfully reduced the candidate passwords to approximately 0.5% of the total number of possible combinations, streamlining the process and significantly increasing efficiency.

Features:
Generates 20-digit passwords specifically optimized for FRITZ!Box routers.
Utilizes a set of meticulously crafted rules to filter out weak passwords.
Employs random sampling to identify strong passwords efficiently.
Allows the user to specify the total number of passwords to be generated.
Thread-safe and optimized for performance.
Achievements:
Achieved a drastic reduction in the pool of possible passwords, reducing the combinations by approximately 99.5%, targeting the FRITZ!Box router algorithm.
Ethical Use:
This software is intended strictly for ethical and responsible use. Its primary function is to assist in enhancing the security of your own network. It is neither designed nor permitted to be used for illegal activities, such as unauthorized network access, hacking, etc.
